Rdio - Spotify Artist Follow
============================

This script will match the artists you follow on Rdio to artists on Spotify. Unfortunately Spotify currently has no open API to directly follow artists, so the best we can do is display their "follow" widgets. Lots of them. All on the same page.

### Steps

1. Download this repo from git
2. Download and install Node.js
3. Open terminal and change dir to the repo on your local harddrive
4. Run "npm install"
5. Run "node artistmatch"

A web page should appear from Rdio asking if you trust this app. Click accept. Shortly after the script will run and a new webpage will return with all the follow widgets embeded. Let the clicking ensue.
